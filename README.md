## About Project
<p> Machine Learning Project to predict Breast Cancer</p>
<p> Dataset Analysis.</p>
<p> Model creation.</p>
<p> Model deployment.</p>

### Project Deployment
* [Project deployed on Heroku](https://cancpred01.herokuapp.com/).

## Project Information
The dataset is comprised of mutliple features which are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).
The dataset contains information about whether those cells were benign or malignant.

## Dataset Information
* Taken from: [sklearn.datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).
* Dataset also located on: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).
